# 👋 Hi, I'm Kumar Mangalam Chowdhury

🌱 **Public Health meets Technology**  
I'm a public health and social development professional with experience working across government systems, NGOs, and underserved communities. My work blends health systems thinking with digital tools—building solutions that are human-first, data-informed, and built to last.
