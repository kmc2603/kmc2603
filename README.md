# 👋 Hi, I'm Kumar Mangalam Chowdhury

🌱 **Public Health meets Technology**  
I'm a public health and social development professional with experience working across government systems, NGOs, and underserved communities. My work blends health systems thinking with digital tools—building solutions that are human-first, data-informed, and built to last.

💻 **What I Do**  
From implementing the India Hypertension Control Initiative (IHCI) to statewide telemedicine onboarding and digital platform rollouts, I work at the intersection of community care and technology.  
Whether it’s training frontline health workers on digital apps or leading e-health initiatives in low-resource settings, I believe in **tech that empowers—not overwhelms**.
